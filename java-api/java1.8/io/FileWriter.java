 * {@description.open}
 * Convenience class for writing character files.  The constructors of this
 * class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer
 * size are acceptable.  To specify these values yourself, construct an
 * OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
 * {@description.close}
 *
 * {@property.open}
 * <p>Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the
 * underlying platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be
 * opened for writing by only one <tt>FileWriter</tt> (or other file-writing
 * object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in this class
 * will fail if the file involved is already open.
 * {@property.close}
 *
 * {@description.open}
 * <p><code>FileWriter</code> is meant for writing streams of characters.
 * For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a
 * <code>FileOutputStream</code>.
 * {@description.close}
